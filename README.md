## Overview

ElectroCrypt is a voting platform that augments prevalent blockchain powered _e-voting_ systems with the integration of cloud technology, in order to provide strong security, flexible ballot casting, attack mitigation, and public auditing for transparency.

ElectroCrypt's two main objectives are:

- A seamless platform to raise voice against oppression and dominance
- Amplify community rights

## Architecture

The system creates a bridge between decentralized <Network-Name> with <Storage-Component-Name> powered by [Platform Name](#) services.
