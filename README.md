# CryptoBeacon - Annonymous and transparent decentralized platform for inclusive communities

_This PoC is developed as a solution for the MLH Neighborhood Hackathon (14-16 May 2021_)

## PoC Progress for MVP

- [x] Develop a smart contract with basic functionalities
- [x] Setup Dev environment and test locally
- [x] Deploy on Polygon Mumbai Testnet ( Deployed Contract [Here](https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/address/0xfe87576951D8c0d0c33Fd3053Cc586a461BD8c5E/contracts))
- [x] Working Web3
- [x] Set up initial front-end structure
- [ ] Build working Web3 for Front-end structure
- [ ] Connect Web3 with Deployed contract
- [ ] Set up and integrate IPFS
- [ ] Deploy Dapp Frontend on netlify

## Overview

**CryptoBeacon** is a community platform where people from all over the world can come to share their speeches and report the things happening concurrently. The data is secured and communicated through a **blockchain network**, a peer-to-peer decentralized technology coupled with a crypto storage facility. This allows people to overcome local restrictions imposed on internet connectivity and omits the need of using a _Virtual Private Network_ to access state-blocked contents and resources.

CryptoBeacon's two main objectives are:

- Estatablish a seamless platform to amplify community rights
- Provide annonymity and overcome state-level censorships

## Architecture

CryptoBeacon leverages the advantages of [Polygon Network](https://matic.network), which is a blockchain decentralized application platform that provides hybrid _proof-of-stake_ and _plasma-enabled_ sidechains.

The system creates a bridge between distributed file storage system powered by **IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)**.

## Features

- Annonymously publish a activity update on a decentralised app via wallet
- Ciew latest updates/news from the platform without any restrictions
- Each activity update can be Upvoted by the community to establish trust

## How it works

<img src="assets\system-arch.png" /><br>

The decentralized aspect is designed using **Ethereum** based scalable and efficient solution - **Polygon**.
We have used **IPFS**, which is a secured peer-to-peer network file storage. It helped us to remove single points of failure in our developed system. Combining all these, we have built this inclusive solution.

## Key benefits

- Overcome censorship and domain ban
- Resistant to most traditional web application attacks
- No VPN required
- No single point of failure
