# CryptoBeacon - Annonymous and transparent decentralized platform for inclusive communities

_This PoC is developed as a solution for the MLH Neighborhood Hackathon (14-16 May 2021_)

## Overview

ElectroCrypt is a voting platform that augments prevalent blockchain powered _e-voting_ systems with the integration of cloud technology, in order to provide strong security, flexible ballot casting, attack mitigation, and public auditing for transparency.

ElectroCrypt's two main objectives are:

- A seamless platform to raise voice against oppression and dominance
- Amplify community rights

## Architecture


<ProjectName> leverages the advantages of [Polygon Network](https://matic.network), which is a blockchain decentralized application platform that provides hybrid _proof-of-stake_ and _plasma-enabled_ sidechains.

The system creates a bridge between decentralized <Network-Name> with <Storage-Component-Name> powered by [Platform Name](#) services.
